# EMOTUNES
EmoTunes addresses limitations in existing music recommendation systems by introducing real-time emotional detection through facial expression analysis. This innovative approach captures users' immediate emotional states, ensuring more dynamic and responsive music recommendations. The system automates playlist creation based on emotional categorization, reducing user effort and enhancing the relevance of suggested playlists. EmoTunes' multi-dimensional categorization considers valence, danceability, and energy, providing a nuanced understanding of user preferences for a more emotionally resonant and personalized music experience. Additionally, the system streamlines the user experience by automating the addition of these emotionally tailored playlists to users' accounts.
